    "Step 1: Getting the User’s Name\n",
    "    The program starts by asking for the user’s name with the input() function.\n",
    "    The username is the raw input (what the user types).\n",
    "    The capitalize() function is used to make sure the first letter of the name is uppercase.\n",
    "Step 2: Defining the BMI Function\n",
    "    This defines a function called bodymassindex that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI).\n",
    "    The function takes two inputs: height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).\n",
    "    It uses the formula for BMI: BMI = weight / height².\n",
    "    The result is rounded to two decimal places using round().\n",
    "    The return statement sends the calculated BMI back to the main part of the program.\n",
    "Step 3: Asking for Height and Weight\n",
    "    The program asks the user for their height and weight using input().\n",
    "    The float() function converts the user’s input into a decimal number so that the program can do the necessary calculations.\n",
    "    The variables h and w store the height and weight values entered by the user.\n",
    "Step 4: Calculating the BMI\n",
    "    The program calls the bodymassindex() function, using the user’s height (h) and weight (w).\n",
    "    The function calculates the BMI and returns the result, which is stored in the bmi variable.\n",
    "Step 5: Printing the BMI and BMI Category\n",
    "    The program prints the calculated BMI along with the user’s name.\n",
    "Step 6: Determining BMI Category\n",
    "    The if-elif-else structure checks which BMI category the user falls into.\n",
    "    If the BMI is 18.5 or below, the user is underweight.\n",
    "    If the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, the weight is normal.\n",
    "    If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, the user is overweight.\n",
    "    If the BMI is 30 or above, the user is classified as obese.\n",
    "    Based on the BMI value, the program prints a message telling the user their BMI category.\n"

    "        Kelvin=Celsius+273.15\n",

    "    The input() function displays a message and waits for the user to type in their temperature.\n",

    "Step 6: Counting Each Word\n",

    "        word.lower() changes all letters to lowercase so that \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are treated as the same word.\n",
    "        isalpha() checks that the word is only made up of letters (ignoring numbers and symbols).\n",
